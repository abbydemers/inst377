<hl>My page is about dogs.</hl>
<p>I love dogs and I have a dog.</p>

<h1>My dog is named Tucker.</h1>


<p>Tucker is a black lab and is 6 months old. He is the cutest thing ever. We adopted him
    when he was 3 months old. I miss him when I am at school. I can not wait to see him
    on Thanksgiving break. I will take him on so many walks and cuddle with him all the time.
